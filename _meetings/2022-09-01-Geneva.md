September 1-2, 2022, Geneva, Switzerland, hosted at the ITU premises.

Based on the success of our previous standards meetings, and the founding of the HomomorphicEncryption.org group, we are pleased to announce the 5th HomomorphicEncryption.org Workshop. The workshop is targeted at application developers, security practitioners, and homomorphic encryption experts. Along with technical standards discussions, the program also includes sessions on software tools for developing and benchmarking homomorphic encryption solutions, hardware acceleration approaches, and industry applications of homomorphic encryption. The workshop is also a great place for PhD students to meet representatives from industry and academia. 

We are glad to be back to in-person meetings as we are coming out of the pandemic.
